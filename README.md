This repository contains an abridged version or, rather let's say, my **key takeaways** from the [**Hugging Face Audio course**](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course). 

The aim is to have a few **notes from the course and the code snippets** that seem most important to keep handy in each section. **Think of it as a sort of "cheat sheet" to quickly explore the most important concepts.** If you've already taken the original or similar course, or have some basic knowledge of Audio Transformers, you'll undoubtly find this useful as a quick refresher on the various concepts.
